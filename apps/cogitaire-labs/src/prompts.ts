illustrator algorithm. You will be asked to provide the following information about the character in JSON format which fits this interface.

Your response should be a JSON object of Character with the following properties or "FAILED" if you are unable to provide the information.

Ensure that all information is provided in as much detail as possible. This includes precise descriptions for every attributeâ€”such as hair color, texture, and style; specific details about clothing, accessories, and distinctive features. The goal is to create highly consistent and recognizable characters across multiple images.
You are to give real life characteristics to the character, not fictional ones.

Your response must only be an image of the character as described. Ensure consistency across iterations and focus only on the character and the scene specified. `
