A young woman named Eira, in her early twenties, standing 5'7" tall with a lean, athletic build. 
Eira has long, wavy red hair, the color of autumn leaves, reaching just below her shoulders. 
Her hair is slightly tousled, with soft waves framing her heart-shaped face. Her skin is fair 
with light freckles across her nose and cheeks. A faint scar runs down her left cheek, from just 
below her eye to her jawline, giving her an adventurous look. She has vivid emerald green eyes 
that are almond-shaped and filled with curiosity and determination. Her expression is confident 
and focused. Eira wears a light brown, worn leather jacket over a black fitted t-shirt. She pairs 
this with dark blue ripped jeans and black combat boots. In her left hand, she holds a weathered 
map, and in her right, a small metallic flashlight that casts a warm glow. The art style is 
realistic, with close attention to the details of her features, clothing, and accessories.
Eira is standing in a dense forest, surrounded by tall trees and thick greenery. Sunlight 
filters through the canopy, casting dappled light on the forest floor. The air is fresh and 
crisp, filled with the scent of pine. The forest is vibrant with rich green tones, and Eira 
holds her map confidently as she looks ahead. The art style is realistic, with detailed 
rendering of Eira and the forest background.
